How to use it

List containers are implemented as doubly LL

Constructor(n, val) - constructs a container w n elements. Each element is is a copy of Val 

void push_front (val) - Inserts a new element at the beg of the list, right before the its current first element. 

std::list<int> myList (4,100) [100,100,100,100]

myList.push_front (200); [200,100,100,100,100]

C++ also supports Iterators:
for (list<int>::iterator it=mylist.begin();)

^^ returns the beg of the list AKA 200

To use an iterator u first make ur conatiner like above and then iterate through it
